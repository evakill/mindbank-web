Whenever he asked for feedback or advice from industry leaders, he would get contradictory opinions making any decision even more confusing. At the core of The MindBank’s founding goal was to provide a place where these contrasting opinions could be raised in dialogue together, in the hope this would result in a clearer path forward for the many startups that seek advice.\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        To this day, that starting principle remains steadfast. The MindBank does not have one culture, one worldview or one opinion - it has countless. This serves to make sure that every problem is assessed from all perspectives and results in insights from our team that can only arise when people disagree and challenge each other in this way, forming an ultimately clearer path informed by each viewpoint.\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        Since it’s inception, The MindBank has grown quickly and found a particular niche in the heart of the college campus, where our team, which consists only of students, can provide the most value. Whether working with multinational corporations on how to better market to students or teaming up with a campus based startup to help them better structure their organization, The MindBank is always able to use this unique student insight to help our clients obtain their intended results.\n        <br/>\n        <br/>\n        Today, The MindBank works with both groups that have a physical presence on campuses as well as business that target millienials more broadly....\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <br/>\n      <b className=\"is-size-2\" style={styles.flatTitle}>MANAGEMENT</b>\n      <div style={styles.redBarHoriz}></div>\n      <div className=\"columns is-multiline is-mobile\">\n        {management.map((member) => (\n          <Member member={member} />\n        ))}\n      </div>\n      <b className=\"is-size-2\" style={styles.flatTitle}>CONSULTANTS</b>\n      <div style={styles.redBarHoriz}></div>\n      <div className=\"columns is-multiline is-mobile\">\n        {members.map((member) => (\n          <Member member={member} />\n        ))}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <Footer/>\n  </div>\n\n);\n\nexport default Team;\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAOA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAOA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AALA;AAfA;AACA;AAsBA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AApCA;AACA;AAwCA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
